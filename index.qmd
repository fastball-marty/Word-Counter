### Overview

Below is a word counter for *Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded* by Samuel Richardson that tracks how often each word appears in the text. There are two counters: one includes every word, and the other filters out common words such as and, the, I, etc. 

The text is provided by the Gutenberg Press, located at:

<https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6124/pg6124-images.html>. 

The text is in the public domain, and this script is intended for educational and research purposes in accordance with fair use guidelines.

The code for this project is available for y'all to use at:

There, you will find instructions on how to count the words of any .txt file of your choosing. 

### Count all words

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
from myapp import MyApp

my_app = MyApp()

dictionary = my_app.word_count('assets/pamela.txt')
print(my_app.format_output(dictionary))
```


### Count words but remove common words
```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
filtered_dictionary = my_app.filtered_word_count('assets/pamela.txt')
print(my_app.format_output(filtered_dictionary))
```
